# Secure Multi Tier Web Application
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a secure multi-tier web application built to demonstrate various security practices and architectural patterns. The application is composed of different layers, including a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. The repository contains Terraform configuration files to deploy the application across two environments.

## Introduction
This project is a secure multi-tier web application designed to showcase the implementation of various security measures and best practices. 

## Features
- Secure data transmission (SSL/TLS)

- Input validation and sanitization

## Architecture
The application follows a multi-tier architecture, comprising the following layers:

- Presentation Layer: Handles the user interface and client-side logic.

- Business Logic Layer: Processes business rules and data validation.

- Data Access Layer: Manages database interactions and data storage.


## Terraform Configuration
This repository includes Terraform configuration files that use modules to create and deploy the multi-tier application across two environments: development and production. The Terraform scripts automate the provisioning of infrastructure and ensure consistency between environments.

### Environments
- Development Environment: Used for testing and development purposes.

- Staging Environment: Used for deploying the application in a live environment.

### Modules
The Terraform configuration is modularized, making it easy to manage and reuse infrastructure components. Key modules include:

- Networking Modules: Configures VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

- Database Module: Provisions and configures the database instances.

- Application Module: Deploys the application servers and load balancers.

## Running Terraform
To run the Terraform configuration files and set up the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Install Terraform: Ensure that Terraform is installed on your system. You can download it from Terraform's official website.

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zamacraig/Secure-Multi-Tier-Web-Application.git
cd Secure-Multi-Tier-Web-Application/terraform
```

3. Initialize Terraform: Navigate to the environment directory (e.g., development or production) and initialize Terraform.

```bash
cd development
terraform init
```

4. Review and customize variables: Review the variables.tf file and customize any variables as needed.

5. Apply the Terraform configuration: Run the following command to create the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform apply
```

5. Confirm the action when prompted.

6. Destroy the infrastructure (optional): If you need to tear down the infrastructure, you can use the following command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can access it via the URL provided by the Terraform output. You can create an account, log in, and start using the features provided by the application.

## Configuration
The application can be configured using environment variables. Refer to the .env.example file for a list of available configuration options.

## Security Considerations
This project focuses on implementing various security measures to ensure the application's integrity and confidentiality. Some of the key security considerations include:

- Use of HTTPS for secure data transmission

- Proper input validation and sanitization

- Implementation of role-based access control

- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
